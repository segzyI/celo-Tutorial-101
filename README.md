# How to Build a Rental Service Smart Contract on Celo Blockchain Network

In this tutorial, you will build a rental service smart contract on the [Celo](https://celo.org/) blockchain network. This will enable users to spend Celo on transactions.

A rental service is a business that provides customers or users the ability to temporarily use a good or service for a fee. The rental service can apply to a wide range of products, including vehicles, equipment, appliances, and more.

Rental services have become popular because they offer individuals and businesses a flexible way to access and use various items without incurring the full cost of ownership. This flexibility allows customers or users to use a product when they need it, without the burdensome responsibility of maintenance, storage, and repairs.

Overall, rental services have proven to be a helpful solution for many people seeking to use temporary goods or services.

Examples of rental services companies include [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](https://www.enterprise.com/en/home.html), [Zipcar](https://www.zipcar.com/) among many others.

## Building our smart contract

In this section, we will build the smart contract for our application.

### Create a Solidity File

Before you start building your smart contract,

1. Navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
    
2. Create a new File
    
3. Name it `RentalServices.sol`
    

If you don't know how to create a file in Remix IDE, follow this [link](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/file_explorer.html#creating-new-files).

### Create Data Structures

For this tutorial, you will create two data structures(Struct):

* **Property Struct**: This will hold information about the property on rent.
    
* **Booking Struct**: This will hold information about booked properties.
    

Add the code below to `RentalServices.sol`

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;

contract RentalServices {

  // struct for Property to be rented out
  struct Property {
    string name;
    string description;
    bool isActive; // is property active
    uint256 price; // per day price 
    address owner; // property owner
    bool[] isBooked;
    // Is the property booked on a particular day,
    // For the sake of simplicity, we assign 0 to Jan 1, 1 to Jan 2 and so on
    // so isBooked[31] will denote whether the property is booked for Feb 1
  }

  uint256 public propertyId;

  // mapping of propertyId to Property object
  mapping(uint256 => Property) public properties;
```

At the top of our code, we have the following

* `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` : This is a special type of comment in Solidity that indicates the software license that the smart contract is released under. In our code, we specified the `MIT` license,
    
* `pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0`: This is a compiler directive that tells the Solidity compiler which version of the language to use. In this case, we specified that the contract should be compiled using a version of Solidity that is greater than or equal to `0.8.0` and less than `0.9.0`.
    
* `contract RentalServices`: The contract keyword declares a contract under which our code is encapsulated.
    

Next, we declared `struct Property` with some properties:

* `string name`: This is the name of the property to be rented out.
    
* `string description`: This gives a description of the property.
    
* `bool isActive`: A flag that denotes if the property is active or not.
    
* `uint256 price` : This is the price per day to rent the property.
    
* `address owner` : The Celo address of the person who owns the property.
    
* `bool[] isBooked`: This is an array of boolean values that denote whether the property is booked or not on a particular day.
    

Next, we declared some state variables

* `uint256 public propertyId`: This is a public variable of type `uint256` that will hold the unique identifier for each property.
    
* `mapping(uint256 => Property) public properties`: This is a mapping that will store the information about each rental property using its unique `propertyId` as the key.
    

Now, we need to create a Bookings struct. Add the code below to your existing code.

```solidity
 struct Booking {
    uint256 propertyId;
    uint256 checkInDate;
    uint256 checkoutDate;
    address user;
  }

  uint256 public bookingId;

  // mapping of bookingId to Booking object
  mapping(uint256 => Booking) public bookings;
```

The code above declares a new struct called `Booking` that has four variables:

* `uint256 propertyId`: This specifies a unique ID that identifies the property being booked.
    
* `uint256 checkInDate`: This specifies the booking start date.
    
* `uint256 checkoutDate`: This specifies the date booking end date.
    
* `address user`: The address of the user who booked the property.
    

Next, we declared some state variables

* `uint256 public bookingId`: This is a public variable of type `uint256` that will hold the unique identifier for each booking.
    
* `mapping(uint256 => Booking) public bookings`: This is a mapping that will store the information about each booking using its unique `bookingId` as the key.
    

### Define Events

Next, we will create some events. Add the code below to `RentalServices.sol`.

```solidity
// This event is emitted when a new property is put up for sale
  event NewProperty (
    uint256 indexed propertyId
  );

  // This event is emitted when a NewBooking is made
  event NewBooking (
    uint256 indexed propertyId,
    uint256 indexed bookingId
  );
```

* `event NewProperty`: This event is emitted when a new property is put up for sale.
    
* `event NewBooking`: This event is emitted when a NewBooking is made.
    

### Smart Contract Functions

In this section, we will write some functions that are required to build our rental services smart contract.

#### `rentOutProperty` Function

This is the first function you will add to your smart contract.

```solidity
function rentOutproperty(string memory name, string memory description, uint256 price) public {

    Property memory property = Property(name, description, true /* isActive */, price, msg.sender /* owner */, new bool[](365));

    // Persist `property` object to the "permanent" storage

    properties[propertyId++] = property;

    // emit an event to notify the clients

    emit NewProperty(propertyId++);

  }
```

The `rentOutProperty` function allows users to list their property for rent on our smart contract. Below is a detailed explanation of the function:

* The `rentOutProperty` function takes 3 parameters that describe the property. The `name` and `description` as strings, and the rental `price` as an unsigned integer.
    
* A `Property` struct is created with the provided parameters, along with a set of boolean values to show availability on each day of the year.
    
* The struct is stored in a mapping called `properties` with `propertyId` as its key.
    
* The function emits an event `NewProperty`.
    
* The `propertyId` variable is incremented to be assigned to the next property added to the database.
    

#### `rentProperty` Function

Add the code below to your smart contract.

```solidity
function rentProperty(uint256 _propertyId, uint256 checkInDate, uint256 checkoutDate) public payable {

    // Retrieve `property` object from the storage

    Property storage property = properties[_propertyId];

    // Check that property ID is valid

    require(property.owner != address(0), "Invalid property ID");

    // Check that property is active

    require(property.isActive == true, "Property with this ID is not active");

    // Check that checkInDate is before checkoutDate

    require(checkInDate < checkoutDate, "Invalid date range");

    // check that property is active

    require(

      property.isActive == true,

      "property with this ID is not active"

    );

    // Check the availability of the property for the specified dates

    uint256[] memory bookedDates;

    uint256 bookedDatesCount = 0;

    for (uint256 i = checkInDate; i <= checkoutDate; i++) {

      if (property.isBooked[i] == true) {

        // Property is already booked on this date, store the booked date

        bookedDates[bookedDatesCount] = i;

        bookedDatesCount++;

      }

    }

    // If any dates are already booked, revert the transaction with the booked dates

      if (bookedDatesCount > 0) {

      string memory errorMessage = string(abi.encodePacked("Property is not available for the following dates: "));

      for (uint256 i = 0; i < bookedDatesCount; i++) {

      errorMessage = string(abi.encodePacked(errorMessage, uint2str(bookedDates[i])));

      if (i < bookedDatesCount - 1) {

        errorMessage = string(abi.encodePacked(errorMessage, ", "));

       }

      }

      revert(errorMessage);

      }

    // Calculate the total booking price using SafeMath

    uint256 numberOfDays = checkoutDate.sub(checkInDate);

    uint256 totalPrice = property.price.mul(numberOfDays);

     

    // Check the customer has sent an amount equal to (pricePerDay * numberOfDays)

    require(

      msg.value == totalPrice * (checkoutDate - checkInDate),

      "Sent insufficient funds"

    );

    // send funds to the owner of the property

    _sendFunds(property.owner, msg.value);

    // conditions for a booking are satisfied, so make the booking

    _createBooking(_propertyId, checkInDate, checkoutDate);

  }
```

The `rentProperty` function allows users to rent listed properties on our smart contract. Below is a detailed explanation of the function:

* The `rentProperty` function allows a user to rent a specific property by passing the `propertyId`, the `checkInDate`, and the `checkOutDate`.
    
* The function retrieves the `Property` struct from the storage using the provided `propertyId`.
    
* The function checks if the property is active by checking the `property.isActive` value.
    
* The `rentProperty` function checks if the property is available for the specified dates by checking the `property.isBooked` value for each day between `checkInDate` and `checkOutDate`. If the property is booked on any day, the transaction reverts.
    
* The `rentProperty` function requires that the user has sent the right amount for the duration of renting the property.
    
* If the payment transaction is successful,l `_sendFunds` function is called.
    
* Finally, if all conditions are met, `_createBooking` function is called.
    

#### `_createBooking` Function

Add the code below to your smart contract.

```solidity
function _createBooking(uint256 _propertyId, uint256 checkInDate, uint256 checkoutDate) internal {

    // Increment the booking ID before assigning it

    bookingId++;

    // Create a new booking object

    bookings[bookingId] = Booking(_propertyId, checkInDate, checkoutDate, msg.sender);

    // Retrieve `property` object from the storage

    Property storage property = properties[_propertyId];

    // Mark the property booked on the requested dates

    for (uint256 i = checkInDate; i < checkoutDate; i++) {

      property.isBooked[i] = true;

    }

    // Emit an event to notify clients

    emit NewBooking(_propertyId, bookingId++);

  }
```

This code above defines `_createBooking` function, which takes in three parameters- `_propertyId`, `checkInDate`, and `checkoutDate`. Below is a detailed explanation of the function:

* `bookings[bookingId] = Booking(_propertyId, checkInDate, checkoutDate, msg.sender)`: This creates a new `Booking` struct with the struct variables `_propertyId`, `checkInDate`, `checkoutDate`, and `msg.sender` and maps it in the `bookings` mapping at the index of `bookingId`.
    
* `Property storage property = properties[_propertyId]`:This retrieves the `Property` struct corresponding to the passed `_propertyId` from the storage and assigns it to the local variable `property`.
    
* `for (uint256 i = checkInDate; i < checkoutDate; i++) { property.isBooked[i] = true`: This loops through the dates from `checkInDate` to `checkoutDate`. For each date within the range, it sets the corresponding `isBooked` value at `property.isBooked[i]` to `true`. This marks the property as booked for the dates within that range.
    

#### `_sendFund` Function

Add the code below to your smart contract.

```solidity
function _sendFunds (address propertyOwner, uint256 value) internal {

    payable(propertyOwner).transfer(value);

  }
```

This code above defines a `_sendFunds` function, which takes in two parameters - `propertyOwner` of type `address`, and `value` of type `uint256`.

`payable(propertyOwner).transfer(value)` :This transfers the specified `value` of Celo to the `propertyOwner` address.

#### `_MarkPropropertyAsInactive` Function

Add the code below to your smart contract.

```solidity
function markPropertyAsInactive(uint256 _propertyId) public {

    require(

      properties[_propertyId].owner == msg.sender,

      "THIS IS NOT YOUR PROPERTY"

    );

    properties[_propertyId].isActive = false;

  }

}
```

This code above defines a function called `markPropertyAsInactive` that takes in one parameter, `_propertyId`. Below is a detailed explanation of the function:

* `require(properties[_propertyId].owner == msg.sender, "THIS IS NOT YOUR PROPERTY")`: This checks whether `msg.sender` (i.e., the caller of the function) is the owner of the specified property. If the caller is not the owner, the function will throw an error message.
    
* `properties[_propertyId].isActive = false`: This sets the owner's property `isActive` to `false`, effectively making it inactive.
